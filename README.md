# University Ranking Software based on Webometrics Criteria

## Introduction

Using data collected from researching and analyzing complex networks, our team built a software to rank Vietnamese universities based on the Webometrics ranking criteria. We propose effective methods to improve international rankings based on the analysis results. Our software provides a reliable reference source for recognizing university rankings and identifying which criteria universities need to change to achieve higher rankings.

## Webometrics Ranking Criteria

Our software uses the following criteria in the Webometrics ranking system:

- Openness: reflects the spread of academic research from universities. Accounts for 10% of the total ranking criteria.
- Impact: based on the number of backlinks from other websites to the university's website, reflecting the influence of the educational institution's web content. Accounts for up to 50% of the total ranking points of that educational organization on the Webometrics ranking table.
- Excellence: based on the number of articles published by the university's team of lecturers and scientists on scientific journals that are cited most in the top 10% of the Scimago ranking table.
